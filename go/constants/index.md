# Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword.  
Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.  
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

```go

const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
  const World = "世界"
  fmt.Println("Hello", World)
  fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

  const Truth = true
  fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

# Numeric constants

Numeric constants are high-precision values.

```go
const (
  // Create a huge number by shifting a 1 bit left 100 places.
  // In other words, the binary number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes.
  Big = 1 << 100
  // Shift it right again 99 places, so we end up with 1<<1, or 2.
  Small = Big >> 99
)
```
