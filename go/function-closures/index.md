# Function closures

* A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body
* The function may access and assign to the referenced variables

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// In this example, adder() is being called multiple timesâ€”the anonymous function is
// The anonymous function is a closure, which keeps the variable myAdder alive
func adder() func(int) int {
	sum := 0

	return func(x int) int {
		sum += x
		return sum
	}
}

func main() {
	// Create a new instance of the adder function closure
	myAdder := adder()

	// Use the closure to add numbers
	fmt.Println(myAdder(1)) // Prints: 1
	fmt.Println(myAdder(1)) // Prints: 2
	fmt.Println(myAdder(1)) // Prints: 3
}
```
