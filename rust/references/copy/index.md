# Copy

* Rust's simplest types are known as `Copy` types
* They are all on the stack, and the compiler knows their size
* You don't need to worry about ownership for these types

To determine if a type is `Copy`, check the documentation  
For example, the documentation for `char` says that it is `Copy`:  
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html

On the left in the documentation, you can see `Trait Implementations`.  
There you can see, for example, `Copy`, `Debug`, and `Display`. With that,  
you know that a `char` is:

* Is copied when you send it to a function (`Copy`) 
* Can use `{}` to print (`Display`)
* Can use `{:?}` to print (`Debug`)

Another type that is `Copy` is `i32`:

```rust
// There is no -> so the function does not return anything. If number was
// not a Copy type, the function would take it, and we couldn't use it again.
fn prints_number(number: i32) {
    println!("{}", number);
}

fn main() {
    let my_number = 8;
    prints_number(my_number); // prints_number gets a copy of my_number.
    prints_number(my_number); // And again here. Itâ€™s not a problem because my_number is a Copy type!
}
```
