# Bevy Journey

[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust.

## Suggested learning approach

Read through the [The Bevy Book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction). Although, quite basic at the moment, there are plans on improving the document.
This guide will give you a general perspective of what to expect.

[Bevy Cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io) more extensive guide, goes through a great deal of explaining each part of Bevy (Entities, components, systems, queries, etc).

Unfortunately, both guides dont exactly explain/show you how to put those parts together. Few suggestions here is to look at the example code at:

- [Bevy examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/v0.5.0/examples)
- [Bevy ECS examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.5.0/crates/bevy_ecs/examples)

Note, do not use `main` branch as there are subtle changes that occur quite frequently.  
Instead, use the current version. At the time of writing, `0.5` is the latest version
