# AWS Copilot Journey

[AWS Copilot](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-aws-copilot/), is designed for both existing ECS users, and new ECS users who want to move beyond manual management of lower-level infrastructure, and instead just start thinking about their application and its lifecycle. Copilot creates modern application deployments by default, based on production-ready patterns that include best practices designed by ECS engineers and customers over the years.
